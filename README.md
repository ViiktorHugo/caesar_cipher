# caesar_cipher

Caesar Cypher is a encryption program, with a terminal based menu.

You can encrypt or decrypt small amouts of text.
It has 3 phases:
1 - Typing the text you want to manipulate;
2 - Typing the secret key to encrypt or decrypt the text;
3 - Select the type of operation you want to do, 0 - encryption and 1 - decryption.


In current version, the program does not store any data.
The first phase only accepts the alphabet.
